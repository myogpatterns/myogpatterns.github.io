                                            Embark on the initial phase of our pattern review by conducting an editorial review of the instructions. Dive into the clarity, completeness, and coherence of the instructions packet. Kindly consider the materials list and ensure you have ample time to acquire the necessary items to complete Phase 2 on time. Your valuable insights will contribute to refining our instructions for optimal user understanding.
                                        </p>

You are welcome to initiate Phase 2 (the Pattern Test!) during Phase 1 of the review. However, please be prepared to accommodate potential updates to the pattern materials as Phase 1 progresses. This flexibility ensures that your testing experience aligns seamlessly with any refinements made during the editorial review phase. Additionally, we encourage you to share your experience, challenges, and the final outcome through photos, and feel free to provide any additional comments or clarifications on the instructions.
