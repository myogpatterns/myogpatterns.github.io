  Athletic fit thermal joggers that pair perfectly with our [Alpha Raglan Hoodie](/alphaRaglan)

  - Wear casually on their own, layered, or to extend your quilts comfort range
  - Designed for Polartec® fabrics including Alpha® Direct, the ultralight performer
  - Optional seat and knee reinforcing overlays for vintage mountaineering durability
  - Regular rise with crotch gusset for frontcountry comfort
  - Roomy, bulk-free hand pockets that stay in place and won't bunch up
  - Low profile yoga-style stretch waistband with an elastic-free construction
  - Tapered leg and stretch cuffs prevent sleep pants from riding up all night

  ### Garment Fit

  Alpha Camp Pants have an athletic jogger fit. Relaxed around the hips and thigh. Slim leg that tapers to a stretch-knit ankle cuff. Full rise with crotch gusset for squat comfort and easily adjusted pant length to nail the perfect fit.

  For a women's fit, common adjustments may include shortening the pants rise, shortening the inseam, or adjusting the leg taper. Instructions are included based on successful independent pattern tests. Thank you [@Ms.Math](https://www.instagram.com/ms.math/), [@Madeby_Francesca](https://www.instagram.com/madeby_francesca/), and [@Discovery Fabrics](https://www.instagram.com/discoveryfabrics/)

  ### Body Measurements

  The sewing pattern covers a wide range of sizes corresponding to men's XS to XXL. Full hip/seat is the main sizing measurement, the maximum horizontal circumference around hips and butt. See body measurements shown in photo gallery above.

  ### Sewing Skill Level - Advanced Beginner

  Alpha Camp Pants are designed for knit fabrics. While the instructions detail every step, familiarity with sewing terms and construction techniques is expected. Serging simplifies construction however a zig zag and overlock stitch work just as well to maintain stretch and finished raw edges. This is a straightforward beginner apparel pattern and stretch fabrics are forgiving. Make a prototype and have fun!
