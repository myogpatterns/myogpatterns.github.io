        Fabric selection for the main body of backpacks and bikepacking bags
        often trades weight against durability and cost. Non-breathable coated
        fabrics and laminates provide water resistance against inclement
        weather, but most are not 100% waterproof. Fabrics woven with higher
        denier threads feel more durable and help provide a more rigid
        structure.

      <h2 id="linings">Stuff Sacks and Linings</h2>
      <p>
        For lightweight bags, stuff sacks, pack liners, pockets, etc durability
        generally isn't a major concern. Weight and water proofness may be. A
        color pop or bright interior are crucial. Coated and impregnated fabrics
        are highly water resistent, but are not 100% waterproof. Ripstop grids
        increase the tear resistance of these lightweight fabrics. Non-coated
        variants are breathable and may be calendered to be downproof and
        windproof.

          While non-breathable, silnylon is strong and easy to wipe clean.
          Numerous colors can be found and its very affordable. Similarly
          silpoly is an impregnated polyester. Nylon is stronger, but silpoly is
          more UV resistant and has less stretch making it better for tarps.

      <h2 id="stretch">Mesh and Stretch Pockets</h2>
      <p>
        Mesh pockets, stretch bottle pockets, padded back panels, and vest
        straps. Fabrics are typically described to stretch in one direction
        (2-way) or lenght and width (4-way). Varying percent stretch and
        durability are important to selecting the right materials. Ordering
        samples is a smart idea as sources and descriptions vary significantly.
        These stretch wovens are generally a blend of either polyester or nylon
        with elastane/spandex/lycra.

          Excellent for very stretchy pockets, Lycra mesh is a very lightweight,
          tightly woven 4-way stretch. Its quite durable for the weight however
          not the best choice for high abrasion areas like a bottom pocket.
          Expect 50-80% stretch depending on weight. For higher abrasion, and
          weight, look to Spandura or medium weight lycra mesh similar to
          spandex for athletic wear.

          Unlike spandex, Duraweave is very strong and has less stretch. These
          stretch meshes are durable, maintain stretch well, and many are quite

          depending on lycra content.

          For padded back panels and shoulders straps, 3D Spacer Mesh is one of
          the few air mesh materials widely available to MYOGers. Typically
          found in 3mm (1/8") or 6mm (1/4"). Breathable and padded, it can be
          used either side facing skin. It sews well as its easy to compress and
          has very minimal stretch. I prefer 3mm and often line with a PU coated
          ripstop panel.

      <p>
        Shoulder straps, hip belts, suspension back panels, and rigid
        bikepacking bags are lined with foam. For load carrying backpacks, a
        combination of foam and plastic frame sheet provide effective weight
        transfer to a hip belt. Closed cell foam is desired as a denser more
        durable foam that won't absorb water. Its easy to cut with a hobby knife
        or rotary cutter and readily accessible to purchase online for cosplay
        community. PE foam is used by the big brands and I'm still looking for a
        source for low MOQ, small sheets for hobbyists.

          pack making and easy to work with. 4-6mm thicknesses work well for
          back panels and 6-10mm is perfect for padding strap and hip belts. If
          your project requires sewing through the foam, be sure to check the
          max height of your presser foot to ensure you choose the right size
          foam!

          For load carrying backpacks, weight transfer to a hip belt requires
          some sort of back suspension. A plastic frame sheet with or without
          metal stays is a lightweight option. ABS plastic is almost always
          black with one side textured and one side smooth. Its easily cut with
          woodworking tools or by scoring and snapping a hobby knife. I find
          this 3-pack of 12x24 inch 1/16" thick sheets to be the most economical

          HDPE plastic is another common option for plastic frame sheets. HDPE

          faster when using woodworking tools. A great source for HDPE is cheap

            For outdoor gear and apparel, use case and expected environment
            drive the main design criteria. Weight often must be traded against
            durability and cost so you should decide for yourself when fabric
            weight is more important.
