							<h3>FAQ</h3>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<dl>
								<dt>May I buy a physical pattern?</dt>
								<dd>Yes, but not directly from me. Check out <a href="https://refasten.ca/pages/patterns">ReFasten.ca</a> for a couple patterns. Stay tuned for more options in the very near future! 🤫</dd>

								<dt>Where to have patterns printed on large format paper?</dt>
								<dd>Most print shops will have 36" wide paper (NA) or A0 (UK/EU). My preferred online print shop is <a href="https://patternprintingco.com/">Pattern Printing Company</a>. They offer color prints on 16# paper in low quantities, shipped folded. They are fast and their customer service has been great. Another popular option is <a href="https://pdfplotting.com/">PDF Plotting</a>.</dd>

								<dt>May your patterns be used for my own sewing business?</dt>
								<dd>LearnMYOG patterns are for personal use only. Make gear for your friends and family. Sure, offload unwanted items on r/ULgeartrade or Instagram to reduce waste. <br> Small businesses, Reddit sellers, Etsy shops, etc -- please respect indie creators and their wishes. 

								<dt>Can I use your pattern to teach a class or club event?</dt>
								<dd>Sure! Please make sure every student or participant purchases their own copy. You're welcome to get in touch for a wholesale rate. Email me at <a href="mailto:admin@learnmyog.com">admin@learnmyog.com</a> to discuss.</dd>

								<dt>May patterns be returned?</dt>
								<dd>As these are digital products, they may not be returned.</dd>

								<dt>Total noob here, how to learn more about MYOG?</dt>
								<dd>First, check out my <a href="/zerotohero.html">Zero to Hero</a> page. I recommend an approach to using the patterns on my site to progress your sewing skills while making your own outdoor gear. Second, I had the opportunity to talk all about Getting Started on <i>Riptop on the Record</i> podcast, episode 42. Watch the video or listen to the podcast on your preferred platform.

								</dd>

								<dt>Which needles and thread to get started?</dt>
								<dd>Gutermann Sew-All polyester thread in 500m spools is an excellent all purpose construction thread. 
									This same thread is available under the commercial name Gutermann Mara 100. For slightly thicker and stronger thread, Mara 70 is ideal for all sorts of outdoor gear. 
									For needles, a small starter pack of Universal needles in the #11-16 size range will get you through your first few projects. Ready for more specific information, check out <a href="/zerotohero.html#thread">Needles & Thread</a> where I have much more detailed needle and thread pairings for different gear and apparel applications.</dd>
								
								<dt>What's the best sewing machine for getting started?</dt>
								<dd>Check out my <a href="/zerotohero.html#tools">Sewing Machines</a> article where I provide desired features to look for and offer suggestions for budget friendly machines.
								</dd>
								
								<dt>Serger yay or nay? </dt>
								<dd>Yes! But refer to <a href="/zerotohero.html#tools">Sewing Machines</a> for more on sergers.</dd>

								<dt>Do you sell gear, prototypes, custom work, etc?</dt>
								<dd>Not currently and I have no immediate plans to. Alway interested in new ideas for projects though!</dd>
								
								<dt>What software do you use for patterning?</dt>
								<dd>I create digital sewing patterns using <a href="https://inkscape.org/" target="_blank">Inkscape</a>, a free and open source tool primarily for illustrators. Outside of Inkscape, I use homegrown python scripts to automate the boring repetitive tasks. If that's up your alley, learn more at <a href="https://github.com/myogpatterns" class="icon brands fa-github"> Github</a>.</dd>
								
								<dt>How long have you been sewing?</dt>
								<dd>I sewed my first backpack in 2017, used for a <a href="https://www.outdoors.org/destinations/massachusetts-and-new-hampshire/" target="_blank">hut-to-hut</a> hike in the White Mountains. I've been sewing much more since 2019. LearnMYOG started in 2020.

								</dd>

								<dt>Is LearnMYOG.com a full-time job?</dt>
								<dd>LearnMYOG is a hobby project created to share ideas and help others make their own outdoor gear. 
								</dd>
								
								<dt>Did you go to design school?</dt>
								<dd>Nope, I'm learning to sew and pattern as an introverted hobbyist.</dd>
								
								<dt>Do you work in the outdoor industry?</dt>
								<dd>Not yet! Professionally I'm an engineering program manager. If you're reading this and can help make those connections, please reach out.</dd>
