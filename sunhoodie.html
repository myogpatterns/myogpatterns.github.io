                      <header><h3>Fabrics</h3></header>
                      <div class="content">
                          <p>When shopping for fabrics to sew a sun hoodie, especially one intended as a summer base layer, it's essential to consider stretch, breathability, and UV protection. This guide will help novice and intermediate sewists understand what to look for in fabrics to ensure comfort, functionality, and durability for outdoor activities like backpacking.</p>
                          <h4>Key Considerations</h4>
                          <ul>
                              <li><strong>UPF (Ultraviolet Protection Factor):</strong> Fabrics with a UPF rating block UV radiation, protecting your skin from harmful sun exposure. A UPF rating of 30-50+ is ideal for outdoor sports and activities.</li>
                              <li><strong>Benefits for Backpacking:</strong> UPF-rated fabrics reduce the risk of sunburn and long-term skin damage. This is particularly important for prolonged outdoor exposure during activities like hiking and backpacking.</li>
                              <li><strong>Stretch:</strong>Look for knit fabrics with 30-50% stretch. This ensures the fabric moves with you and provides a comfortable fit. Check the fabric content label for spandex or elastane, which provides the necessary stretch.</li>
                          </ul>
                          <h4>Fabric Content</h4>
                          <ul>
                              <li><strong>Polyester/Spandex Blends:</strong> Common for performance wear, these fabrics are lightweight, moisture-wicking, and quick-drying. They also often have built-in UV protection.</li>
                              <li><strong>Nylon/Spandex Blends:</strong> Similar to polyester blends, these are durable, stretchy, and moisture-wicking. Nylon blends tend to be a bit more durable and softer.</li>
                              <li><strong>Bamboo/Spandex Blends:</strong> Bamboo fabrics are soft, breathable, and have natural antibacterial properties. They also provide excellent UV protection.</li>
                              <li><strong>Polyester/Bamboo/Spandex Blends:</strong> Combining the benefits of polyester and bamboo, these blends are stretchy, moisture-wicking, and breathable, with added softness and UV protection.</li>
                              <li><strong>Merino Wool Blends:</strong> Merino wool is renowned for its softness, breathability, and natural odor resistance. It provides warmth in cool weather and stays cool in the heat, making it an excellent year-round fabric.</li>
                              <li><strong>Modal/Spandex Blends:</strong> Modal is a type of rayon made from beech tree pulp. It's soft, breathable, and absorbent, often blended with spandex for added stretch and durability.</li>
                          </ul>

                          <h4>Body Measurements and Fit Guide</h4>
									<ul>
										<li><strong>Comprehensive Fit Guidance:</strong> Our pattern instructions feature detailed guidance on achieving a personalized fit, including common adjustments for sleeve length, back length, hip grading, and more. These adjustments have been successfully used by individuals of all shapes and sizes, providing confidence that your garment will be tailored to your unique proportions.</li>
										<li><strong>Inclusive Sizing Range:</strong> Embrace a wide range of chest sizes, spanning from 30 inches to 52 inches, corresponding to ready-to-wear sizing from XXS to XXL. With such versatility, our pattern accommodates a diverse array of body types, ensuring there's an option for everyone.</li>
										<li><strong>Illustrated Custom Fit Techniques:</strong> Our instructions feature clear illustrations of custom fit adjustments, empowering you to modify the pattern according to your specific measurements and preferences. Whether you're a seasoned sewist or new to pattern adjustments, our visual guidance makes the process accessible and straightforward.</li>
										<li><strong>Preview Finished Garment Sizes:</strong> Refer to the pattern preview photo in the gallery above for a glimpse of the finished garment sizes. This resource provides valuable information on how the pattern fits, allowing you to compare your chosen size with existing garments before you begin your project.</li>
										<li><strong>Real-World Example:</strong> In the photos, you'll find a real-world example of the pattern in action. At 6'0" tall, 170 lbs, and with a 39" chest, I comfortably wear a size medium.</li>

                          <h4>Pattern Difficulty</h4>
                          <p>This is a confident beginner pattern as working with knits can be difficult. As knits stretch, sewing with a regular sewing machine is made possible with stretch stitches and zigzag stitch. However for more professional and faster construction, use of a serger is recommended.</p>
