                                    <h3>Fabrics</h3>
                                </header>
                                <div class="content">
                                    <p>When shopping for fabrics to sew a sun hoodie, especially one intended as a summer base layer, it's essential to consider stretch, breathability, and UV protection. This guide will help novice and intermediate sewists understand what to look for in fabrics to ensure comfort, functionality, and durability for outdoor activities like backpacking.</p>
                                    <h4>Key Considerations</h4>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>UPF (Ultraviolet Protection Factor):</strong> Fabrics with a UPF rating block UV radiation, protecting your skin from harmful sun exposure. A UPF rating of 30-50+ is ideal for outdoor sports and activities.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Stretch:</strong>Choose knit fabrics with 30-50% stretch to ensure the fabric moves with you and provides a comfortable fit. Fabrics with lower stretch percentages (around 30%) are easier to sew with a regular sewing machine. For fabrics with higher stretch (over 50%), using a serger is recommended for best results.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <h4>Fabric Content</h4>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Polyester/Spandex Blends:</strong> Common for performance wear, these fabrics are lightweight, moisture-wicking, and quick-drying. They also often have built-in UV protection.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Nylon/Spandex Blends:</strong> Similar to polyester blends, these are durable, stretchy, and moisture-wicking. Nylon blends tend to be a bit more durable and softer.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Bamboo/Spandex Blends:</strong> Bamboo fabrics are soft, breathable, and have natural antibacterial properties. They also provide excellent UV protection.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Polyester/Bamboo/Spandex Blends:</strong> Combining the benefits of polyester and bamboo, these blends are stretchy, moisture-wicking, and breathable, with added softness and UV protection.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Merino Wool Blends:</strong> Merino wool is renowned for its softness, breathability, and natural odor resistance. It provides warmth in cool weather and stays cool in the heat, making it an excellent year-round fabric.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Modal/Spandex Blends:</strong> Modal is a type of rayon made from beech tree pulp. It's soft, breathable, and absorbent, often blended with spandex for added stretch and durability.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <h4>Minimum Yardage Recommendation</h4>
                                    <div class="table-wrapper">

                                    <p>This is a confident beginner pattern. As knits stretch, sewing with a regular sewing machine is made possible with a walking foot attachment and zigzag stitch. A serger is highly recommended. <a href="/articles/sewingKnitFabrics.html">Tips & Tricks to Tame Stretchy Knit Fabrics</a></p>

                                        <li><strong>Inclusive Sizing Range:</strong> Embrace a wide range of chest sizes, spanning from 30 inches to 52 inches, corresponding to ready-to-wear sizing from XXS to XXL. With such versatility, our pattern accommodates a diverse array of body types, ensuring there's an option for everyone.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Preview Garment Sizes:</strong> Refer to the table below for a glimpse of the garment sizing. This resource provides valuable information on how the pattern fits, allowing you to determine if this pattern is right for you.</li>
